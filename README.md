## üß© Abstract

>Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) reporting is pivotal in contemporary risk management strategies. As the volume of CTI reports continues to surge, the demand for automated tools to streamline report generation becomes increasingly apparent. While Natural Language Processing techniques have shown potential in handling text data, they often struggle to address the complexity of diverse data sources and their intricate interrelationships. Moreover, established paradigms like STIX have emerged as de facto standards within the CTI community, emphasizing the formal categorization of entities and relations to facilitate consistent data sharing. In this paper, we introduce AGIR (Automatic Generation of Intelligence Reports), a transformative Natural Language Generation tool specifically designed to address the pressing challenges in the realm of CTI reporting. AGIR's primary objective is to empower security analysts by automating the labor-intensive task of generating comprehensive intelligence reports from formal representations of entity graphs. AGIR utilizes a two-stage pipeline by combining the advantages of template-based approaches and the capabilities of Large Language Models such as ChatGPT. We evaluated AGIR's report generation capabilities both quantitatively and qualitatively. The generated reports accurately convey information expressed through formal language, achieving a high recall value (0.99) without introducing hallucination. Furthermore, we compared the fluency and utility of the reports with state-of-the-art approaches, showing how AGIR achieves higher scores in terms of Syntactic Log-Odds Ratio (SLOR) and through questionnaires. With our tool, we contribute to the automation of Cyber Threat Intelligence practices by reducing report writing time by 42.6\%, thereby simplifying and streamlining the process for any organization.
